## User story

As a user, I want to move up & down.  
I want to see my current score (progress towards level boss).  
I want to see my current patience points.  
I want to see what kind of food Homeless wants.  
I want to have a little dog as cute as Homeless is! 

## Goals  

The intent of this project is to showcase my understanding of concepts taught so far in GA SEI.  
This project will be done using a canvas space in HTML, and JS functions running at set intervals will move the projectiles from the right to the left of the screen.  
The player will be able to control Homeless using the up and down arrow keys, which will be wired to JS code that will allow movement of the element representing Homeless.  
There will be a total of three levels, each with their own projectile speed and their own bosses.  
I'd also like to have some quality image assets as part of the game, so as to depict Homeless' adorability as possible.
I also just wanted to make a game about Homeless since she is the funniest and cutest little dog!  

## Homeless's story

One day, a raggedy little pomeranian showed up on my sister's front porch and refused to leave, even after my sister tried shooing her away and left for work.

After coming home from work, my sister saw the shape the dog was in, which wasn't great. My sister took the dog to the vet, where they had to remove several clumps of matted fur, some scabs, and all teeth.

Initially, my sister tried rehoming the pom since the dog had many issues sharing a living space, likely caused by what she had gone through prior to encountering my sister. After a few weeks of asking around, someone finally responded and offered to take the pom off of her hands.

However, in the time it took to find someone who wanted a raggedy and mean pom, the dog had begun to show just a sliver of love and vulnerability, which was enough for my sister to decide that the pom was staying right where she was, and named the dog "Homeless" (my sister has a very straightforward approach to pet naming conventions).

In the three years since finding her home, Homeless has gone from a raggedy prickly pom who snaps at anything who moves, to a patchy only-mean-when-you-move-too-quickly-around-her-food princess who loves belly rubs and shows her appreciation by giving you kisses on the nose.

We love you, Homeless!
